# Binary_Counter_on_7_Segment
The purpose of the project is to design a two-digit counter on the GO Board FPGA. Counting result will be increment by 1 each time we press the button (or switch).
This project used multiple techniques to accomplish the two-digit 7-segment-display counter.

###Switch Debounce Module: 
To filter out unstable signal that generated by switches (Range:0~10 ms).

###BCD Module: 
Converting Binary data to Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) in order for 7-segment-display to show each digit.

###7-segment-display Module: 
Using Hexdecimal encoding method to display number 0~9 for each digit on 7-segment-display.
